# Deep Learning

**Three Steps for Deep Learning**

- Step 1: define a set of function
- Step 2: goodness of function
- Step 3: pick the best function

## **Neural Network**

Different connection leads to different network structures.

Network parameter $\theta$: all the weights and biases in the "neurons".

**Fully Connect Feedforward Network**
